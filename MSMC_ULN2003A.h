    \brief     Multi Stepper Motor Control with ULN2003A.
    \details   The class allows the contemporary control of multi stepper motors using the ICs ULN2003A. After the motor setup, you can drive the motor forward and backward,
               specifying the number of steps and the delay in microseconds between two consecutive steps. The function update performs the effective motor motion, it must be call 
               in the main loop and, if the delay is expired, the function moves the motor of one step.
